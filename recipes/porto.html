    <h1>Portokalopita</h1>
    <img src="porto.webp">
    
    <p>Portokalopita is a deliciously different cake, and a must-try for anyone who <br>
        is afraid of phyllo. Why? Because here the phyllo is shredded to bits<br>
        —the messier the better! The gorgeous orange and cinnamon syrup ensures this <br>
        cake stays beautifully moist.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <h3>Syrup:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 orange, halved</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cake:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
            <li>3 oranges</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) container Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>¾ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 cups sugar, water, and cinnamon in a saucepan over medium-high heat. <br>
                Squeeze in orange juice and add juiced halves. Bring to a boil and boil vigorously<br>
                 for 8 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool while you prepare the cake.</li>
                 <br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking <br>
                pan with some olive oil.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Remove phyllo sheets from the package. Tear each sheet roughly into shreds and pile up<br>
                 in the baking pan. Let shredded phyllo dry out a little while you prepare the remaining<br>
                 ingredients. Cut 1 orange in half, and slice 1 half into very thin half-moons to garnish <br>
                 the cake. Zest and juice the remaining 2 1/2 oranges.</li>
                 <br>
            <li>Combine orange juice, orange zest, eggs, yogurt, olive oil, 1/2 cup sugar, and baking powder<br>
                 in a blender or food processor. Blend together on high speed until frothy, about 2 minutes.<br>
                  Pour orange and egg mixture over the shredded phyllo in the baking pan. <br>
                  Stir everything together gently to ensure that the egg mixture is evenly distributed. <br>
                  Garnish top of the cake with the orange slices.</li>
                  <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden and the filling set, about 45 minutes.<br>
                Remove from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup over the hot cake. <br>
                Set aside for at least 1 hour, until most of the syrup has soaked in. <br>
                Slice into squares and serve.</li>
                
        </ol>
