    <h1>Marzetti Casserole</h1>
    <img src="image.webp">
    <p>Kids love this buffet-ready casserole dish. <br>
        My mother-in-law used to make a simpler version of this for my <br>
        husband when he was growing up.<br>
         This version pushes the flavor profile a bit. <br>
         I prefer to have this dish sit overnight before baking as the <br>
         flavors improve and the pasta absorbs some of the sauce so the <br>
         consistency is just right.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces rotini pasta</li>
            <li>½ pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced green bell pepper</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (14.4 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
                Add pasta and cook until just al dente, 6 to 8 minutes; drain. <br>
                Run cold water over the pasta to stop pasta from cooking further. <br>
                Set aside.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the ground beef and sausage until completely browned<br>
                 and crumbled, 7 to 10 minutes. Mix in the onion, celery, garlic, and pepper;<br>
                  continue to cook and stir another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.<br>
                   Remove from heat and stir in tomatoes and tomato sauce. <br>
                   Allow to cool five minutes.</li>
                   <br>
            <li>Lightly grease a large casserole dish. Spread the pasta over the bottom of the dish. <br>
                Sprinkle the Italian cheese blend over the pasta. Pour the meat mixture over the pasta<br>
                 and cheese. Cover dish with heavy aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes;<br>
                 remove foil and sprinkle Cheddar cheese evenly over the casserole.<br> 
                 Continue baking until Cheddar cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. <br>
                 Rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
